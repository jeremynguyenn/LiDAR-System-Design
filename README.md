# Introduction
To enhance the coverage of a limited-angle 3D LiDAR sensor, a servo motor-driven electromechanical rotation system was developed. This system enables the MRS 1000 3D LiDAR from SICK to capture high-resolution point clouds by rotating along the y-axis, thereby accessing previously unreachable areas. A dedicated ROS package was implemented to manage LiDAR data transformation, mapping, modeling, visualization, servo motor control via rosserial, and IMU integration. The external IMU provides real-time orientation feedback, supporting accurate environment reconstruction. A real-time digital twin of the system was visualized in RViz.

## Mechanical Design and Manufacturing
The electromechanical system  was designed using Autodesk Fusion 360 and features a robust frame constructed from aluminum profiles. The design incorporates several components manufactured with a 3D printer, ensuring the systemâ€™s mechanical integrity and adaptability.

## System Architecture
In this ROS-based system, the integration of a 3D LiDAR rotation mechanism with a SICK MRS 1000 sensor, an IMU, and a servo motor is implemented. The /mcu_imu_gps_servo node orchestrates servo motor positioning and IMU data collection. Raw LiDAR point clouds are published by the /sick_mrs_1xxx node on /cloud. Servo position decoding is managed via /nt16_to_servo_pos and transmitted through /servo_pos_header. Real-time coordinate frame alignment is achieved using /imu_tf_broadcaster and /LIDAR_tf_broadcaster, both publishing to /tf. The /pointCloud_transformer node transforms the raw point cloud data into a global frame, outputting it as /transformed_cloud. Visualization and monitoring are performed in real time using RViz, facilitating system validation and environmental modeling.
